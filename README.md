# ShelterSync
ShelterSync  is a web-based pet shelter management system designed to replace paper records with a digital inventory. Built with a Java Spring Boot backend and a JavaScript/HTML/CSS frontend, this application allows shelter staff to manage animal profiles and provides a public gallery for potential adopters to browse available pets.
